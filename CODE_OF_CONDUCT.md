# 🌸 MantraOS Code of Conduct

## Our Guiding Principles

This project is a **satsang** — a gathering of truth-seekers — around the fire of technology.  
We hold ourselves to the timeless principles of:

- **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** Our words and actions must never cause harm.  
- **Seva (Service):** Contributions serve the community, not ego.  
- **Sādhanā (Practice):** We honor steady, consistent effort, even in small steps.  
- **Satsang (Shared Truth):** We cultivate clarity and honesty.  

We welcome children, parents, students, elders, developers, and seekers of all kinds.  
This is a safe space for **learning, building, and growing together**.

## Expected Behaviors

- Speak and write with kindness.  
- Respect different levels of knowledge: from child learners to expert engineers.  
- Teach gently, without condescension.  
- Credit others' work generously.  
- Choose sustainable, mindful design approaches when possible.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusion of any kind.  
- Aggression, insults, or hostile debates.  
- Intentionally harmful code contributions (e.g., backdoors, sabotage).  
- Dismissing questions or mocking beginners.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness harm:

1. Reach out to a project maintainer (see [README](README.md)).  
2. Describe what happened with honesty and calmness.  
3. We will listen with compassion and act to restore harmony.

## Consequences

- **First misstep:** gentle reminder, with guidance on better practice.  
- **Repeated missteps:** temporary contribution pause.  
- **Persistent harm:** removal from project community.  

Always, our goal is **restoration, not punishment**.
