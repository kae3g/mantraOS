## üñºÔ∏è Asset Contributions (Mascot/Logo)

Detailed in [assets/logo/CONTRIBUTING-assets.md](assets/logo/CONTRIBUTING-assets.md).

Quick summary:

- Drop PNG drafts into `assets/logo/drafts/incoming/`.  
- Run `make logo-vectorize` ‚Üí produces paired `.png + .svg` in `processed/`.  
- Run `make logo-validate` ‚Üí checks naming, pairs, sizes.  
- Archive optional sets via `make logo-archive TAG=v001`.  
- Style: Guardian Dragon, calm, protective, asymmetrical, natural armor.

## üß™ Docs QA: Link Audit, Nav Ribbons, and Quick Links

We enforce a gentle-but-strict docs discipline so learners never get lost:

**What's checked automatically**
- **No absolute Markdown links** (no `](/path.md)`), so links are branch-agnostic.
- **No over-up `../../` paths** (keeps structure simple and portable).
- **Nav Ribbon required** at the top of:
  - `001-sadhana.md`
  - all curriculum files in `030-edu/`
  (must contain "Return to the Dragon's Front Door", "Repository Map (lantern scroll)", and "Curriculum Index")
- **Quick Links footer required** for *all* stage scrolls (Stages 1‚Äì10):
  - must contain "Curriculum Index", "Visual Tree Diagram", and "Return to README".

**Run locally**
```bash
bash scripts/check-relative-links.sh
```
If everything is fine, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Link audit clean. All Markdown links are branch-agnostic.
```
On failures, the script prints the offending lines and the **tail of the file** for context.  
You can adjust the context length:
```bash
TAIL_LINES=40 bash scripts/check-relative-links.sh
```

**Pre-commit hook (recommended)**
```bash
bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```
This installs a `pre-commit` hook that runs the audit automatically before each commit.

**CI checks**
- GitHub Actions runs the same audit on pushes/PRs:
  - `.github/workflows/relative-links-check.yml`
- If you add deeper subdirectories or special cases, update:
  - `scripts/check-relative-links.sh`
  - (Optional) set `LINK_AUDIT_IGNORE` for temporary exceptions.

**Style guidance**
- See `docs/STYLE-LINKS.md` for examples of correct relative links from various folders.
- From `030-edu/` to repo root, prefer `../README.md` style.
- Avoid leading slashes and multiple `..` hops unless absolutely necessary.

**Optional one-off cleanup**
```bash
# If any legacy docs still mention "Bhagavad Gita", normalize them to
# "≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam (Uddhava Gƒ´tƒÅ, Canto 11)" across text-like files:
make purge-bhagavad
```
This is a convenience wrapper around `scripts/purge-bhagavad-gita.sh`.  
It is **not** part of CI and is intended for occasional maintenance only.  
Once the cleanup has been applied and committed, please **delete the script**
(`scripts/purge-bhagavad-gita.sh`) and remove its Makefile target.

> Our goal is kindness for future readers: consistent navigation, no dead ends, and links that work everywhere.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è 80-Column Line Wrapping (Markdown)

We keep Markdown/text at **‚â§ 80 columns** for clean diffs and readability.

**Wrap locally**
```bash
# Dry-run
python3 scripts/wrap-markdown.py
# Apply
APPLY=1 python3 scripts/wrap-markdown.py

# With Make
make wrap-md
```

**Enforce locally**
```bash
make check-80
# or
MAX_COL=80 bash scripts/enforce-80.sh
```

**CI**
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/line-length.yml`
- The checker prints the tail of offending files for context.
- Increase context:
  `TAIL_LINES=40 make check-80`

See `docs/STYLE-WRAP.md` for details and edge cases.
