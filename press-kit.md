**MantraOS — An Operating System for the Soul in the Digital Age**

---

## ✨ Mission

We are raising a **Guardian Dragon**:  
a new kind of computer that is **gentle, sustainable, and kind**.  

Our mission is to create technology that:  
- Extends device lifespans **20+ years**.  
- Respects **right-to-repair, right-to-upgrade, right-to-recycle**.  
- Encourages **mindful use** instead of addictive scrolling.  
- Builds resilience through **local-first networking** and **community memory**.  
- Educates children, parents, and communities in **sustainability and digital well-being**.

---

## 🌍 Problem

- Conventional devices are **Taking Dragons**: they consume rare earths, encourage compulsive use, and fail within 3–5 years.  
- **Recycling rate** is under 20%.  
- **E-waste** is the fastest growing waste stream globally.  
- **Attention harm:** mental health impacts, distraction, and loss of presence.  

---

## 🌱 Solution

- **MantraBox & MantraPhone**: modular, IPX4 splash-resistant, drop-resistant, and easily repairable.  
- **Guardian Services**: silence bell, reflection log, mercy mode, local-first networking.  
- **E-ink displays**: gentle for the eyes, power efficient.  
- **FRU (Field-Replaceable Units):** RAM, battery, and screen are modular and labeled with QR recyclability codes.  
- **Educational Kit**: workbooks, coloring books, and teacher guides for mindful technology.

## 🙏 Closing Blessing

> **SB 11.29.22**  
> *sarva-bhūteṣu yaḥ paśyed bhagavad-bhāvam ātmanaḥ  
> bhūtāni bhagavaty ātmany eṣa bhāgavatottamaḥ*  
>
> "He who sees the Divine in all beings, and all beings in the Divine, is the greatest devotee."

May our technology remember the forest.  
May our devices serve life, not consume it.  
May our dragon breathe kindness, not fire.
