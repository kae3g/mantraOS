# 030 â€“ Drop Test Plan (E-paper Safe)

**Goal:** Survive everyday mishaps (desk height, backpack) with e-paper intact.

## Setup
- Concrete tile with thin vinyl overlay (worst typical case)  
- Heights: 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m  
- Orientations: face, back, each corner, each edge (MIL-STD-810 style)

## Procedure
1. **Display Pre-Pattern**: Set "safe" high-contrast static pattern.  
2. **Drops**: 26 total (MIL profile); inspect after each.  
3. **Post Checks**: Ghosting evaluation, connector retention, gasket compression, RAM/module seating.

**Pass Criteria**: No panel cracks; acceptable minor scuffs; all modules retained; boots without artifact beyond normal clearing.
