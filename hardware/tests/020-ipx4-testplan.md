# 020 â€“ IPX4 Test Plan (Serviceable Sealing)

**Goal:** Verify splash resistance from any direction **without** permanent adhesives.

## Equipment
- IPX4 spray nozzles or oscillating tube fixture  
- Color tracing dye  
- Absorbent indicator sheets  
- Torque driver (calibrated)

## Procedure
1. **Pre-check**: Inspect gaskets; confirm torque on perimeter screws.  
2. **Baseline**: Place dye indicators inside around seams and ports.  
3. **Spray**: 10 min oscillated spray, 10 L/min total, all directions.  
4. **Open & Inspect**: No dye penetration beyond splash ledges.  
5. **Serviceability**: Remove cover, replace gasket, re-run test.  
6. **Aging**: 50 open/close cycles; re-test.

**Pass Criteria**: No internal ingress beyond designed wet zones; device boots; no corrosion paths initiated.
