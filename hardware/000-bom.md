# 000 – Draft Bill of Materials (BOM) for mantraBox / mantraPhone

> **SB 11.10.5** *yadṛcchayā labdha-santuṣṭaḥ…* "Satisfied with what comes by
> chance, beyond dualities, resting in My mercy."

This BOM prefers **simplicity, serviceability, and long life**. Where exact part
numbers vary, choose open, well-documented parts.

---

## 1) Compute Core

- **SoC (low-power)**:
  - Option A (proto): ESP32-S3 class for early Inkplate prototypes. Option B
  - (richer userspace): RISC-V SoC (dual/quad core, low TDP).
- **PMIC**: Simple, documented PMIC; LiFePO4 charge profile support preferred.
- **RTC**: Low-drift RTC with coin cell / supercap backup.

**Rationale**: low heat, long sleep, and public docs.

---

## 2) Memory & Storage

- **RAM Module** (mezzanine):
  - Baseline 4–32 GB; SI budget and routing clearances for 64/128 GB future.
  - Retention bracket + single connector; **no potting**.
- **Storage**:
  - microSD slot (user-serviceable) **or** socketed eMMC/Flash on module.
  - Bootloader recoverable via USB-C.

**Rationale**: right-to-upgrade; easy refurb.

---

## 3) Display & UI

- **Display**: Inkplate (e-paper) size per device; front glass standoff;
compliant foam; corner protection.
- **Touch** (optional): Low-frequency touch or side buttons to avoid accidental
wake.
- **Keyboard**: Quiet scissor or short-throw mech; field-replaceable keycaps.
- **Haptics**: Optional small linear motor; gentle feedback only.

---

## 4) Radios & Wired

- **USB-C**: Data + charge; **rubber port cap** option for IPX4. **LoRa**
- (village shout): Replaceable module, u.FL connector with gasketed
feedthrough.
- **Wi-Fi/LAN**: LAN-first design; Wi-Fi intentionally conservative; hardware RF
switch where possible.

---

## 5) Power & Battery

- **Cell Chemistry**: LiFePO4 preferred for safety/longevity; otherwise Li-ion
pouch with QR'd recycling.
- **Battery Sled**: Pull-tab removal; JST/XT30 keyed; **no adhesives**.
- **Charger**: USB-C PD negotiated; low-current default to preserve cell life.

---

## 6) Enclosure & Seals

- **Shell**: Wood composite or bio-based plastic; **screwed**, not glued.
- **Gaskets**: TPE/EPDM perimeter; serviceable O-rings for buttons; hydrophobic
acoustic membranes over mic/speaker.
- **Fasteners**: PH0 or T5; torque spec printed under back cover.

---

## 7) Sustainability Identifiers

- **QR Labels** on each FRU (field-replaceable unit) with:
  - Part grade, cycles (for battery), refurb notes, disposal instructions.
- **Material Ledger**: A short `/hardware/ledger.md` mapping materials to
recycling paths.
