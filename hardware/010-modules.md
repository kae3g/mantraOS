**Service flow** (back cover off, 4â€“6 screws):
- Swap **battery** (2 min) â†’ swap **RAM** (5 min) â†’ swap **screen** (10â€“15 min).

## 2) RAM Mezzanine Concept

- **Connector**: low-profile board-to-board; keyed.  
- **Retention**: steel or composite bracket + 2 screws.  
- **Label**: QR code with density, date, refurb grade.  
- **EE Markers**: keep-out zones for future 64/128 GB signal integrity.

**Sustainability**: RAM moves between devices as needs change; modules get second lives.

---

## 3) E-paper Module

- **Frame**: foam gasket around glass perimeter; no shear load on panel.  
- **Cable**: FPC with latch (ZIF) connector; label shows release direction.  
- **Service**: open bezel â†’ unlatch FPC â†’ lift panel from foam bed â†’ replace.

## 4) Waterproofing (IPX4) Without Toxic Potting

- **Perimeter compression** with TPE/EPDM; screws provide even load.  
- **Mic/Speaker** covered by hydrophobic membrane + acoustic mesh.  
- **USB-C** with replaceable rubber cap; internal drip-ledge channels.  
- **Pressure equalization** via ePTFE vent; no foams, no epoxies.

---

## 5) Drop Resistance with E-paper Empathy

- **Inner sled** floats on elastomer posts; corners absorb energy.  
- **Bezel standoff** ensures impacts load the frame, not the e-paper.  
- **Screen "rest mode"**: display service sets a safe pattern before high-risk transport to reduce ghosting artifacts.

## 6) Minimal Pin Map (abstract)

```
J1 (RAM mezz)
1: VDD_1V1   2: VDD_3V3
3: GND       4: GND
5: DQ0       6: DQ1
...
n-1: RESET#  n: I2C_ID (module EEPROM for size/grade)
```

**I2C_ID** lets firmware learn RAM size and show friendly messages:
> "Hello, a 16 GB memory seed has been planted ðŸŒ±."
