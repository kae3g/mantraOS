# 003 – Service Guide: Replacing the Battery (mantraBox / mantraPhone Prototype)

## Introduction

Children, every living being has its breath, its prāṇa. In our devices, the
**battery** is that breath. Without it, the device falls silent. But unlike the
soul, which is eternal, a battery is mortal. It swells, weakens, and one day
cannot hold charge. The **Taking Dragon** would have us throw away the whole
body. The **Guardian Dragon** teaches us instead: *replace the breath, not the
being.*

## Closing Reflection

> *āyur harati vai puṁsām* *"With each rising and setting of the sun, the life
> of all beings is
diminished…"* — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam* 2.3.17

But when we replace a battery, we give back days to the device — more songs,
more lessons, more service. This too is dharma: extending life with compassion.
