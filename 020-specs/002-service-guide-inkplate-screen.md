# 002 – Service Guide: Replacing the Inkplate Screen (mantraBox Prototype)

## Introduction

Children, imagine a window made of glass. If the window cracks, you do not throw away the house — you simply replace the pane.  
In the same way, if the **Inkplate e-paper screen** of a mantraBox breaks, we do not discard the whole device. We gently open it, remove the broken glass, and place a new one.  
This is the path of the **Guardian Dragon** — patient, careful, sustainable.

## Step-by-Step Disassembly

1. **Power Off** the mantraBox and disconnect it from any charger.  
2. **Remove Screws** from the back cover. Place them in a small container.  
3. **Open the Housing**: Insert a plastic spudger at the seam, gently working around until the gasket releases.  
4. **Disconnect the Battery**: Find the JST battery connector on the mainboard and unplug it.  
5. **Locate the Screen Module**: It is mounted at the top with a ribbon cable leading into the mainboard.  
6. **Lift the Retaining Frame**: Unscrew and carefully lift the frame holding the e-paper.  
7. **Release the Ribbon Cable**: Flip up the latch on the ZIF connector and gently slide out the ribbon.

## Replacing the Screen

2. **Inspect the Gasket Rails**: Ensure no debris or adhesive remains. Replace gasket if worn.  
3. **Insert the New Screen**: Align carefully with the mounting posts.  
4. **Reconnect the Ribbon Cable**: Slide into the ZIF connector and lock the latch.  
5. **Re-seat the Retaining Frame**: Screw it back in place, but do not overtighten.

## Reassembly

## Recycling Notes

- **Broken Screen**: Treat as electronic e-waste; return to certified collection.  
- **Packaging**: If your replacement screen came with foam or plastic, recycle according to local rules.  
- **Old Gaskets/Seals**: Compost if biodegradable; otherwise recycle with elastomers.

## Educational Aside

## Closing Reflection

> *punar api jananaṁ punar api maraṇaṁ*  
> *"Again birth, again death, again the cycle."*  

The screen may break, the parts may wear — but through repair, we break the cycle of waste.  
The Guardian Dragon smiles each time a device is given new life.
