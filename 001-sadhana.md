## A Gentle Invitation

Dear reader, welcome. mantraOS is a path of **practice**—not spectacle. It is
about building tools as one would tend a garden: little by little, lovingly,
faithfully.

> **SB 11.20.9** *tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatā
> mat-kathā-śravaṇādau vā śraddhā yāvan na jāyate*
>
> "One should continue to perform duties as long as one is not detached, or
until one develops faith in hearing and chanting about Me."

## The Two Dragons

The **Taking Dragon** thrives on our distraction. The **Guardian Dragon**
thrives on our care. Our sādhana is to build in ways that nurture the Guardian
Dragon.

## Four Pillars of Practice

- **Ahimsā (Non-harm):** No manipulation, no addictive nudges, no exploitative
glue.
- **Satya (Truthfulness):** Plain logs, no dark patterns, clear architecture.
- **Aparigraha (Non-hoarding):** Minimalist software, modular hardware,
recyclable packaging.
- **Dayā (Compassion):** Accessibility, gentleness, silence by default.

## Educational Builds

- **Build 1:** A "Silence Bell" that rings with compassion, not alarm. **Build
- 2:** Local-first notes, free from surveillance. **Build 3:** An Inkplate
- dashboard that breathes softly with you. **Build 4:** A battery replacement
- ritual—a rite of care, not consumption.

> **SB 11.19.36** *dayā bhūteṣu santuṣṭiḥ titikṣoparatiḥ śamaḥ* *ahiṁsā satyam*
> asteyam ityādīnāṁ samāsataḥ*
>
> "Compassion toward all beings, satisfaction, tolerance, self-control,
nonviolence, truthfulness, and honesty—these are the qualities to cultivate."
