# 006 – How Security Is Like Treasure Chests

## Introduction

Children, imagine a chest filled with jewels 💎.  
Would you leave it open in the marketplace? No. You would lock it, give keys only to those you trust, and guard it carefully.  
This is **security** in computing.

## The Treasure Chest Metaphor

- **Chest (Data)**  
  - Your photos, documents, and secrets.  

- **Lock (Encryption)**  
  - Protects the contents from prying eyes.  

- **Keys (Passwords / Keys)**  
  - Given only to those who should open it.  

- **Guard (Firewall)**  
  - Watches who comes close, allowing only trusted visitors.

## Attacks and Defenses

- **Thieves (Hackers)**: Try to pick locks, sneak past guards.  
- **Fake Keys (Phishing)**: Tricking you into handing over entry.  
- **Guardian Dragon**: Ensures locks are honest, guards are alert, and you hold the real key.

## Reflection

A careless lock invites theft. A careful lock, shared wisely, keeps treasure safe.
