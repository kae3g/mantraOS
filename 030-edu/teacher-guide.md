## 🌱 Teaching Philosophy

- **Gentleness First:** Learning should feel like being guided by a kind elder under a banyan tree.  
- **Story + System:** Every technical concept is rooted in a story, metaphor, and bhakti verse.  
- **Activity-Centered:** Learners engage with hands, hearts, and heads — not just eyes.  
- **Inclusive & Accessible:** Activities scale for young children, teens, and adults.  
- **Right Relationship with Technology:** Tools are framed as companions to be cared for, not consumed.
