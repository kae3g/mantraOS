Lesson 5: Files as a Garden         Page 18
──────────────────────────────────────────────

## Hidden Lesson 🌿
Files are like plants: some grow, some wither, some need pruning. Organization
is a form of care, not just tidiness.

---

## How to Guide 👩‍🏫
- Invite learners to imagine files as **seeds, weeds, and flowers**. Encourage
- them to "garden" their folders — keeping flowers, composting weeds. Use a real
- example: clean one folder together.

---

## Takeaway ✨
Children and beginners learn that:
- Devices, like gardens, thrive on **attention and pruning**. Digital clutter
- can weigh us down. Care is a form of sustainability.

---

## Reflection for Adults 🧘
- When was the last time you "weeded" your own files? How did it feel afterward?

---

## Verse 🌸

> **SB 11.19.36** *dayā bhūteṣu santuṣṭiḥ titikṣoparatiḥ śamaḥ ahiṁsā satyam
> asteyam ityādīnāṁ samāsataḥ*

> "Compassion, satisfaction, tolerance, self-control, nonviolence, truthfulness,
and honesty — these are to be cultivated."
