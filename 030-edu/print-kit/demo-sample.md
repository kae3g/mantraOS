────────────────────────────────────────────── 🐉  Lesson 1 – The Two Dragons
Page 1 ──────────────────────────────────────────────

## Story

There are two dragons:

- The **Taking Dragon** 🐉🔥
Hungry, noisy, always wanting more. It takes silence, time, and peace.

- The **Guardian Dragon** 🐉🌱
Gentle, kind, protecting the forest. It warms without burning, guides without
shouting.

Our choice shapes the world.

---

## Activity ✍️  (Practice Space Below)

Draw your dragon here:
- What does its face look like? Is it Taking or Guardian?

[ Blank half-page reserved for drawing area ]

---

## Reflection 🌱

[ ] When has a device taken too much of your time? [ ] What would a Guardian
Dragon have done instead?

> and chanting about Me."

────────────────────────────────────────────── 🌳  Lesson 2 – Kernel as a Tree
Page 5 ──────────────────────────────────────────────

## Prompt

The kernel is like the **roots of a tree** — hidden, but giving life to
everything above.

🌱 Roots = Kernel 🍃 Branches and leaves = Apps

---

## Activity 🖍️

Draw a big tree.
- Show strong roots below ground. Show branches and leaves above.

[ Large blank space reserved for coloring ]

_(Optional watermark: faint gray outline of a tree trunk + roots as a starter
guide.)_

## Quiet Reminder 🌸

> "As watering the root nourishes the tree, so worship of the Lord nourishes
> all." — **SB 11.7.43**

────────────────────────────────────────────── 🌱  Parent & Teacher Guide –
Lesson 5: Files as a Garden         Page 18
──────────────────────────────────────────────

## Hidden Lesson 🌿
Files are like plants: some grow, some wither, some need pruning. Organization
is a form of care, not just tidiness.

---

## How to Guide 👩‍🏫
- Invite learners to imagine files as **seeds, weeds, and flowers**. Encourage
- them to "garden" their folders — keeping flowers, composting weeds. Use a real
- example: clean one folder together.

---

## Takeaway ✨
Children and beginners learn that:
- Devices, like gardens, thrive on **attention and pruning**. Digital clutter
- can weigh us down. Care is a form of sustainability.

---

## Reflection for Adults 🧘
- When was the last time you "weeded" your own files? How did it feel afterward?

---

## Verse 🌸

> **SB 11.19.36** *dayā bhūteṣu santuṣṭiḥ titikṣoparatiḥ śamaḥ* *ahiṁsā satyam*
> asteyam ityādīnāṁ samāsataḥ*

> "Compassion, satisfaction, tolerance, self-control, nonviolence, truthfulness,
and honesty — these are to be cultivated."
