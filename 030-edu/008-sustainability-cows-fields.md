# 007 – How Sustainability Is Like Cows and Fields

## Introduction

Children, in the villages of old, cows were treated with reverence 🐄.  
Fields were plowed with care, not exhausted.  
This is **sustainability**: to live in a way that nourishes the future.

## The Cow and the Field

- **Cow (Device)**  
  - Gives milk (service) again and again.  
  - If cared for, lives many years.  

- **Field (Ecosystem)**  
  - Produces food (resources) if rotated, not overworked.  
  - Needs rest, repair, and balance.

## The Taking Dragon's Way

- Milk the cow until it dies young.  
- Exhaust the field with chemicals until it cannot grow.  
- Build fragile devices, throw them away, demand more.  

---

## The Guardian Dragon's Way

- Care for the cow: let it graze, let it heal, let it live long.  
- Rotate the field: give it time to rest.  
- Build rugged devices, repair them, recycle them.

## Reflection

Every phone or computer is like a cow.  
Will you care for it to live 10 years, or cast it aside after 2?  
Every field is like the Earth. Will you nourish it or exhaust it?

## Closing Mantra

> **SB 11.19.33**  
> *satyam dayā tapaḥ śaucam titikṣānubhavo damaḥ  
> śamāstikṣā śrutam jñānaṁ vairāgyaṁ ca śamāśrayam*  
>  
> "Truthfulness, compassion, austerity, purity, tolerance, control of the senses, peacefulness, tolerance of dualities, knowledge, and detachment—all shelter in self-control."  

So too with mantraOS: for the good of devices, users, and the Earth itself.
