## Introduction

Children, close your eyes and imagine a river 🌊.  
It flows from mountains to valleys, carrying water, fish, and boats.  
In the same way, **networks** carry information from one computer to another.

## The River Metaphor

- **River (Network)**  
  - A flowing channel, connecting distant lands.  

- **Water (Data Packets)**  
  - Droplets flowing together, each carrying a small piece of a bigger message.  

- **Boats (Protocols)**  
  - Structures that help water move safely — like TCP and UDP guiding packets.  

- **Dams and Locks (Routers/Firewalls)**  
  - Control flow, direct it, or stop it.  

---

## Streams and Oceans

- Small **LANs (Local Area Networks)** are like streams: tiny, calm, flowing between a few homes.  
- The **Internet** is like the ocean: vast, deep, sometimes stormy.  

---

## Why Protect the River?

- Polluted rivers harm villages; polluted networks spread spam, viruses, or lies.  
- Guardian Dragon principle: keep flows clean, open, and fair.

## Reflection

Every message you send is like pouring a cup of water into the river.  
Take care that it nourishes, not poisons.

## Closing Mantra

> **SB 11.7.43**  
> *yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ  
> prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā*  
>  
> "As pouring water on the root nourishes the trunk, branches and leaves, and as feeding the stomach nourishes the senses, so worship of the Lord satisfies all."  

So too do messages flow toward their destinations.
