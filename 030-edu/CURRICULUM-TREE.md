## 🌸 Notes

- Each scroll builds on the previous one like a **guru-paramparā** (line of teachers).  
- Links are **relative** so they work across branches (`druid-hills`, etc.).  
- The flow is both **narrative** (story for children) and **technical** (guide for developers).  
- Readers can drop into **any stage** if they have the background, but the sequence is designed for gentle unfolding.
