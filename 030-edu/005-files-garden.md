## Introduction

Children, imagine walking in a garden 🌱🌸🍎.  
There are paths, flowers, fruits, and gardeners who care for it.  
This garden is like the **file system** of a computer.

## The Garden Metaphor

- **Soil (Storage Medium)**  
  - Hard drives, SSDs, or memory cards.  
  - The foundation where everything grows.  

- **Plants (Files)**  
  - Each plant is unique: some small like herbs, some large like trees.  
  - Each file carries its own life.  

- **Paths (Directories)**  
  - Help us find our way.  
  - Without paths, the garden would be chaos.  

- **Gardener (File System Manager)**  
  - Decides where to plant seeds, keeps weeds from spreading.  
  - Ensures no two plants try to grow in the same place.

## Seasons of the Garden

- **Creation**: Planting seeds (making new files).  
- **Growth**: Editing, nurturing, watering (updating files).  
- **Harvest**: Reading, sharing, enjoying (using files).  
- **Composting**: Removing and recycling (deleting files).

## Reflection

A well-kept garden is a joy to walk through.  
A neglected garden grows tangled and hard to enter.  
So too with your file system: organize with care, and it will always give back peace.

## Closing Mantra

> **SB 11.7.39**  
> *jñānaṁ niṣṭhāṁ ca vijñānaṁ dhairyaṁ śauryaṁ balaṁ smṛtiḥ  
> satyaṁ śama-damaḥ śaucam etat saṁsiddhi-lakṣaṇam*  
>  
> "Knowledge, steadiness, wisdom, courage, strength, memory, truthfulness, and control of the mind and senses—these are the signs of perfection."  

Your files are fruits of your labor. Tend your garden well.
