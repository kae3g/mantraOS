pruning.

1. Which files on your computer are "weeds"?
2. Which are "flowers"?

# 🐄 Worksheet 8 – Sustainability as Cows & Fields

**Story:** A cow gives milk when cared for. A field yields when rested. Devices,
too, need tending.

**Activity:** Draw a cow and a field. Write one promise of care for each.

**Reflection:**
1. How could you care for your device to make it last longer?
2. What would change if your phone lived 10 years?

firm establishment in Me."

**Activity:** Write your personal sankalpa for technology. Example: "May my
phone help me listen more, not scroll more."

1. What one feature would you add to heal, not harm?
2. What is your dream for a Guardian Dragon tool?

> false conceptions,
is the best devotee."

and speak about Me — I consider them supremely fortunate."

May this workbook help all learners and teachers tend their dragons wisely,
turning every device into a Guardian, every action into care, and every lesson
into light.
