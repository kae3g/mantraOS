# 001 – Sādhana (साधन)

## A Gentle Invitation

Dear reader, welcome. mantraOS is a path of **practice**—not spectacle.  
It is about building tools as one would tend a garden: little by little, lovingly, faithfully.

> **SB 11.20.9**  
> *tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatā  
> mat-kathā-śravaṇādau vā śraddhā yāvan na jāyate*  
>  
> "One should continue to perform duties as long as one is not detached, or until one develops faith in hearing and chanting about Me."

## The Two Dragons

The **Taking Dragon** thrives on our distraction. The **Guardian Dragon** thrives on our care.  
Our sādhana is to build in ways that nurture the Guardian Dragon.

## Four Pillars of Practice

- **Ahimsā (Non-harm):** No manipulation, no addictive nudges, no exploitative glue.  
- **Satya (Truthfulness):** Plain logs, no dark patterns, clear architecture.  
- **Aparigraha (Non-hoarding):** Minimalist software, modular hardware, recyclable packaging.  
- **Dayā (Compassion):** Accessibility, gentleness, silence by default.

## Educational Builds

- **Build 1:** A "Silence Bell" that rings with compassion, not alarm.  
- **Build 2:** Local-first notes, free from surveillance.  
- **Build 3:** An Inkplate dashboard that breathes softly with you.  
- **Build 4:** A battery replacement ritual—a rite of care, not consumption.

> **SB 11.19.36**  
> *dayā bhūteṣu santuṣṭiḥ titikṣoparatiḥ śamaḥ  
> ahiṁsā satyam asteyam ityādīnāṁ samāsataḥ*  
>  
> "Compassion toward all beings, satisfaction, tolerance, self-control, nonviolence, truthfulness, and honesty—these are the qualities to cultivate."
