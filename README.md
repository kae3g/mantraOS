Hello, little ones. Come, sit. You see this device in my hand? It flickers and glows, much like the thoughts in our own minds. For a long time, these machines have been like hungry dragons, breathing fire and eating up the quiet forests of our attention, leaving behind a sad, smoky haze.

But what if we could teach this dragon a new way? A gentler way? What if its fire could warm us without burning the world?

That is what MantraOS is. It is our attempt to raise a different kind of dragon. A dragon that remembers it is part of the forest, not its master.

## 🐉 The Story of the Two Dragons (The "Why")

Once upon a now, we built a **Taking Dragon**. This dragon is very strong. But it has a hungry heart. To live, it must always take:
*   It takes the shiny rocks from deep inside the Earth, leaving scars.
*   It takes the peaceful silence from our minds, filling it with noise.
*   It takes our time, convincing us to look here and there, but never truly *see*.

This makes the forest—our world—weaker and sadder.

Our dragon, MantraOS, is a **Guardian Dragon**. Its strength comes from **love and care**, not from taking. Its heart beats with a simple rule: **Ahimsa**, which means to do no harm. It believes:
*   The best tool is the one that helps you see the world *more* clearly, not less.
*   The best machine is the one you can fix with your own hands, like a trusted wooden toy.
*   The best connection is the one that helps you talk to the person next to you, not just to faces on a screen.

## 🌱 How Our Gentle Dragon Works (The "How")

When you wake our dragon, it doesn't shout. It whispers.

*   **A Quiet Screen:** Its face is made of **e-ink**, gentle like paper.  
*   **Breathing Lessons:** Sometimes it rings a soft bell, reminding you to pause.  
*   **The Treasure-Making Ritual:** Fleeting thoughts live in memory, but treasures are printed to hemp paper, preserved like seeds of wisdom.

## ⚙️ The Dragon's Body and Heart (The "What")

### The Body (`MantraBox`, `MantraPhone`)
- **Brain:** ESP32 or RISC-V SoC, modest and efficient.  
- **Face:** Inkplate e-paper screen.  
- **Hands & Voice:** Quiet keyboard, simple buttons.  
- **Shell:** Wood or plant-based plastic, screwed not glued, easy to open.  
- **Memory Seeds:** RAM modules (4–32 GB, expandable to 64/128 GB).  
- **Battery:** LiFePO₄ cells in a sled, replaceable without adhesives.  

### The Mind (`Sūtra`)
- Written in **Rust** for calm reliability.  
- Built upon a **microkernel** (seL4 principles: capability security, isolation).  
- **Guardian Services:** silence bell, reflection log, mercy mode, display orchestration, IO gatekeeper, network ferry.  

### The Voice (`Saṅgha`)
- Prefers **direct whispers** (USB-C).  
- Can call across a village using **LoRa**.  
- Treats the internet like a guest house: limited, careful, private.  

---

## 🧠 The Dragon's Shared Dream: A Mindful Village

- **Satsang Graph:** Thoughts as stars, woven together.  
- **Weaving Minds Together:** Two dragons join via USB-C, their maps merge.  
- **Preserving the Dream:** Maps can be printed, hung, then gracefully released.  

---

## 🌍 The Dragon's Greatest Dream: A Circle of Kindness

1. Good deeds written on paper notes with twelve-word mantras.  
2. Notes typed in with focus (*seva*).  
3. Community records stored on **Sandalnet** — a LAN of kindness, resilient even when the sky-web falters.  

---

## 🛠️ How We Are Building the Dragon

* **Egg:** Basic text device with e-ink.  
* **Hatchling:** Gains Satsang Graph.  
* **Young Dragon:** Learns to speak over LoRa.  

We walk gently, with patience.

🌼 If at any time the forest of scrolls feels wide and deep, you may open  
the companion guide [`REPOSITORY.md`](REPOSITORY.md).  
It is a lantern held high, showing how the rooms connect,  
so that parents, students, and developers can all find their way.

### A Prayer from the Uddhava Gītā

> **SB 11.29.34**  
> *sarva-bhūteṣu mad-bhāvo māṁ bhajantam īśvaram* [#SB-11.29.34a]  
> *hitvānyathā-buddhiṁ yo māṁ veda sa mad-bhaktaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ* [#SB-11.29.34b]  
>
> "He who sees Me in all beings, worshiping Me and abandoning false conceptions,  
> is the best devotee."

May our dragons be guardians, not takers.  
May our devices be companions, not masters.  
May our work nourish the forest of life.
