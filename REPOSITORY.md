Welcome, dear reader. This scroll is like a **map of the dragon's library**, a way to wander through the many rooms of our repository without getting lost.  
Think of it as a **companion guide**: a wise parent leading children by the hand, teachers and students walking together, developers opening each cupboard, and elders blessing the whole journey.
