# 🛤️ Roadmap – Raising the Guardian Dragon

This is our shared journey of building **MantraOS**, step by step.  
We walk patiently, like gardeners tending seeds. Each phase is a **life stage** of our dragon.

## 📖 Guiding Principles

- **Ahimsa (Do No Harm):** every phase reduces harm to beings and Earth.  
- **Sādhanā (Practice):** slow, careful, incremental progress.  
- **Seva (Service):** features serve the community, not greed.  
- **Satsang (Shared Truth):** openness and clarity in code, docs, and teaching.

- A global satsang of mindful digital beings.

> **SB 11.20.9**  
> *tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatā  
> mat-kathā-śravaṇādau vā śraddhā yāvan na jāyate*  
>
> "One should perform duties until detachment or steady faith in the Lord's stories arises."  

So too we continue, phase by phase, until steadiness and kindness arise in our technology.
