# 🎨 MantraOS Branding & Logo Design Brief

_Last updated: September 2025_

---

## 🐉 Logo Concept

### Core Symbol
A **gentle dragon curled around a sapling**.  
- The dragon represents **MantraOS**: powerful, but kind and protective.  
- The sapling represents **humanity and the forest**: fragile, growing, in need of guardianship.  

### Style
- **Soft lines, rounded corners** (not fierce, no claws bared).  
- **Eyes closed or calm, not aggressive**.  
- Should feel safe and approachable to **children and families**.

## ✍️ Typography

- **Headings & Titles:** `Noto Serif`  
  - Evokes scripture, suitable for Sanskrit verses.  
- **Body & UI Text:** `Noto Sans`  
  - Clear, modern, child-friendly readability.  
- **Fallbacks:** system fonts (serif/sans) for accessibility.

## 🖼️ Logo Applications

- **Primary Logo:** Dragon curled around sapling, circular form.  
- **Monochrome Version:** Works in black/white for print & e-ink displays.  
- **Favicon/Icon:** Simplified dragon head silhouette, gentle curve.

## 📸 Mascot Possibilities

For educational kits and presentations, the dragon can also be a **friendly guide**:
- Teaching children in storybooks (coloring pages, lessons).  
- Appearing in system boot animations ("Your dragon is waking up").  
- Whispering reminders ("Time for a breath, child").  

---

## 📐 Usage Guidelines

- Minimum clear space: equal to dragon head height.  
- Do not tilt or distort dragon.  
- Use Guardian Green + River Blue for primary lockup.  
- On e-ink or print, fallback to monochrome.

## 💡 Inspiration Sources

- East Asian brush dragons (flowing, cloud-like forms).  
- Medieval manuscript marginalia (gentle creatures, guardians).  
- Children's picture books (soft colors, round shapes).

## 🙏 Closing Blessing

> **SB 11.19.36**  
> *dayā bhūteṣu santuṣṭiḥ titikṣoparatiḥ śamaḥ  
> ahiṁsā satyam asteyam ityādīnāṁ samāsataḥ*  
>
> "Compassion, contentment, tolerance, peace, non-violence, truth, and honesty are to be cultivated."

So too may our logo and colors cultivate peace, gentleness, and honesty.
