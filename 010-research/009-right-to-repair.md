# Stage 9 – Right to Repair and Dharma 🔧

This scroll is both technical and ethical.  
It follows from **Stage 8**, where sustainability is described,  
and prepares for **Stage 10**, the technical vision scroll.  

> Repair is not merely fixing: it is dharma, an alignment with truth and care.  

## Introduction

Children, let us learn why some toys can be mended and others cannot.  
If a doll's arm breaks and you can sew it back on, the doll remains a friend.  
If a phone's battery dies and it is glued shut, the phone becomes trash.  

The **Taking Dragon** wants us to throw away and buy again.  
The **Guardian Dragon** wants us to open, fix, and continue the story.

## Why Right to Repair?

- **Ecological dharma**: Each device that lives longer prevents new mining, new waste, new harm.  
- **Educational opportunity**: Repair teaches children and adults alike *how things work*.  
- **Economic justice**: Repairs cost less than replacements, empowering those with fewer resources.  
- **Cultural continuity**: Devices that can be upgraded become heirlooms, like books or bicycles.

## Design Commitments

1. **No permanent adhesives**: Use screws, clips, and gaskets.  
2. **Standard fasteners**: Phillips, Torx — not exotic tools.  
3. **Documented disassembly**: Service guides published freely.  
4. **Modular design**: RAM, storage, battery, display — all replaceable.  
5. **Marking materials**: Plastics and metals labeled for recycling.

## Example Practices

- **Batteries**: Pull-tabs instead of glue.  
- **Displays**: Protective frames instead of epoxy.  
- **Ports**: Replaceable daughterboards instead of soldered jacks.  
- **RAM/Storage**: Use SO-DIMM, M.2, or LPCAMM2 instead of solder.

## Educational Aside

> **Glossary**  
> - **Right to Repair**: The legal and practical right of users to open and fix their own devices.  
> - **Planned Obsolescence**: Designing products to fail or be unfixable, forcing replacement.  
> - **Heirloom Device**: A computer designed to last a decade or more, passed from one user to the next.

## Closing Mantra

> *yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ*  
> *"Satisfied with what comes by chance, rising above dualities, free from envy."*  
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 4.22*  

When we build tools that last, we learn to be satisfied with what we already have — and we honor the Earth.
