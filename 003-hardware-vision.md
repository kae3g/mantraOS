# 003 – Hardware Vision: mantraBoxes & mantraPhones

## Introduction

Children, imagine the toys you love. Some break the first time they fall, and
your heart aches. Others stay with you for years, patched and mended, still
friends. In the same way, today's devices often behave like the **Taking
Dragon**: fragile, sealed, and built to be thrown away. But mantraOS dreams of
devices shaped by the **Guardian Dragon**: strong, open, repairable, and
enduring — companions, not consumables.

## Ruggedness (Dhṛti – Steadfastness)

- **Drop Resistance**:
  - Design with raised bezels so fragile screens never take first impact. Use
  - elastomer bumpers (like the soft paws of a cat) to absorb shocks. Float
  - e-paper screens on flexible rails instead of gluing them rigidly — so
they bend, not break.
  - Test by the old warrior's trial: **26 drops from 1.2 m** on all sides and
corners, as in MIL-STD-810.

- **Inkplate Screens**:
  - Inkplate modules use glass substrates and are prone to cracking. Solution:
  - sandwich them with a **protective front lens** (glass or thick
acrylic) and mount them with compliant materials that let them flex during
falls.
  - Where possible, prefer e-paper with **polymer substrates** for extra
resilience.

## Waterproofing (Āp – Water)

- **Target**: **IPX4 splash resistance** — protected against splashing water
from any direction.
- **Methods**:
  - **Clamshell chassis** with **continuous silicone gasket**. **Screws and
  - inserts**, not glues, so it can be opened and closed. **Membrane vents**
  - (like Gore-Tex) to equalize pressure and prevent
condensation.
  - **Capped ports** or pogo-pin docks for charging, so the child may play in
the rain without fear.

- **Principle**: Water is not the enemy. Secrecy and inaccessibility are. By
making seals serviceable, we honor both nature and repairability.

## Memory Lifecycle (Smṛti – Remembering)

- **mantraBox (larger systems)**
  - Support **standard replaceable RAM** (SO-DIMM, DDR4/DDR5). Allow a wide
  - range: **4 GB → 128 GB**, depending on need. Reuse and refurbish modules —
  - memory should circulate like books in a
library.

- **mantraPhone (compact systems)**
  - Replaceable **compute modules** (SoC + RAM + PMIC), not soldered mysteries.
  - Possibility of adopting **LPCAMM2** in the future — compact, replaceable,
low-power memory modules.
  - Range: **4 GB → 32 GB** practical, with paths for higher capacities later.

- **Philosophy**: Memory is like wisdom: it should not be soldered away forever,
but passed on, reused, and given new life.

## Sustainability (Śīla – Good Conduct)

- **Long Life as a Blessing**: Extending lifespan is the greatest ecological
act. One device that lasts ten years is gentler than ten disposable ones.
- **Avoidance of Poisons**: No permanent glues, foams, or toxic potting
compounds. Instead, rely on screws, clips, gaskets, and recyclable elastomers.
- **Mono-material Choices**: Easier recycling when plastics are not mixed.
- **Documentation and Guides**: Every device should ship with disassembly
instructions, like scriptures passed to disciples.
- **Right-to-Repair, Right-to-Upgrade, Right-to-Recycle**: The three jewels of
sustainable design.

## Build Philosophy

1. **Strong but Gentle**: Rugged but repairable.
2. **Water as Teacher**: Flow around obstacles, do not fear them.
3. **Memory as Wisdom**: Replace, reuse, circulate.
4. **Sustainability as Dharma**: Not an afterthought but the law of the land.
5. **Service Manuals as Scripture**: Share knowledge freely, so all may repair.

## Educational Glossary

- **IPX4**: A rating meaning splash-resistant — safe against rain, not against
swimming.
- **MIL-STD-810 Drop Test**: A U.S. military standard describing device survival
after repeated falls.
- **SO-DIMM**: A small stick of RAM, replaceable like a cartridge. **LPCAMM2**:
- A new memory module type, designed to be compact and reusable. **Membrane
- Vent**: A breathable but waterproof barrier used in outdoor
electronics.

## Closing Verse

> *kāle nāśyanti bhūtāni bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate* *"Again birth, again death,
> again the cycle."*

The screen may break, the parts may wear — but through repair, we break the
cycle of waste. The Guardian Dragon smiles each time a device is given new life.
