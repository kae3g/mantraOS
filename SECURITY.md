# 🔐 Security Policy – MantraOS

## Supported Versions

MantraOS is under active development.  
Security updates are provided for the **main branch** only until we stabilize a first public release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do no harm.** Please do not exploit it.  
2. **Report privately:**  
   - Email: security@mantraos.org (placeholder, update with actual)  
   - Or contact a maintainer directly.  
3. Provide:
   - Steps to reproduce.  
   - Potential impact.  
   - Suggested mitigations, if possible.  

We will respond within **7 days**.

## Our Approach

- Transparency with kindness.  
- Fixes prioritized by potential harm.  
- All patches reviewed with the **capability model** in mind (no ambient authority).  
- Educational writeups when appropriate, so the community learns from issues.

## Supply Chain Integrity 🌍

Security is not only about software. It is also about **hardware origins**:

- **Ethical Sourcing:** We aim to minimize rare earth usage, preferring abundant and recyclable materials.  
- **Transparency:** Each FRU (field-replaceable unit) includes a QR label with sourcing and recyclability info.  
- **Open BOM:** See [/hardware/000-bom.md](hardware/000-bom.md) for bill of materials.  
- **Audits:** Community members are welcome to review sourcing, recycling, and manufacturing steps.  
- **Avoiding Toxins:** No potting epoxies, foams, or adhesives that block recycling.  
- **Vendor Selection:** Preference for vendors with published sustainability practices.  

---

## Non-Goals

- We are not building "military grade" security.  
- Our focus is **compassionate resilience**, not perfect secrecy.  

---

## Blessing

> **SB 11.19.41**  
> "Hearing, knowledge, renunciation, and self-control — these are protections."  

So too may our protections in MantraOS be built on clarity, restraint, and care.
